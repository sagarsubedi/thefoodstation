# thefoodstation
This is a full stack project built by me using PHP for a class project.
There is a foodstation.sql file that you can simply import using PHPMyAdmin,
which will give you the database that has food data, and other data you can
use to test.
./assets/ has the images and svgs required
./include/ has the css and foodstation.sql file
